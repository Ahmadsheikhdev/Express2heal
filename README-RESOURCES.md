# Psychoeducational Resources Feature

## Overview

The Psychoeducational Resources feature provides users with a simple yet powerful way to find evidence-based mental health resources using Google's search tools. This feature is designed to help users access reliable information without relying on complex AI systems.

## Key Features

1. **Pre-curated Search Queries**: Carefully crafted search queries organized by mental health topics (anxiety, depression, stress management, etc.) that help users find high-quality resources.

2. **Multiple Search Options**: Users can search using Google Search, Google Scholar, or Google Books with a single click.

3. **Saved Searches**: Users can save their favorite search queries for quick access later.

4. **Source Evaluation Tips**: Guidelines to help users evaluate the credibility and reliability of the resources they find.

5. **Recommended Resources**: Direct links to pre-vetted, high-quality resources for each mental health topic.

## How to Use

### Finding Resources

1. **Navigate to the Resources Page**: Click on the "Resources" link in the navigation bar.

2. **Choose a Topic**: Select a mental health topic from the category tabs (Anxiety, Depression, Stress Management, etc.).

3. **Use Pre-curated Searches**: Click on any of the pre-curated search queries to open Google with that search term.

4. **Create Custom Searches**: Enter your own search query in the search box, select your preferred search tool (Google, Scholar, or Books), and click "Search".

### Search Tips

- Add `site:nih.gov` or `site:edu` to your searches to find academic and government sources.
- Use specific terms like "evidence-based" or "research-based" to find scientifically validated information.
- For workbooks or practical resources, add "pdf free" to your search.

### Saving Searches

1. Enter a search query or click on a pre-curated search.
2. Click the "Save" button to save the search for later use.
3. Access your saved searches in the "Saved Searches" section.

### Accessing Direct Resources

2. Click on any resource to open it in a new tab.
3. These resources are pre-vetted for quality and reliability.

## Why This Approach?
